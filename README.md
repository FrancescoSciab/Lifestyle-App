# Contributing
This web app has been entirely created by [me] (https://github.com/FrancescoSciab) as fourth project within my Start2Impact study course.

# Description
Start2Impact supplied me with different similar projects to work for and I've picked this one as I'm particularly interested at wellbeing and sustainable cities and communities.
I chose that specific background picture because of the combination of green and skyscrapers. Plants help also big cities to be more breathable and improves citizen mental health.
