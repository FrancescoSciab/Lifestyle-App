# Lifestyle App
This is a web app that provides a list of quality of life categories and a summary of a city based on user input. The data is retrieved from the Teleport API. The app is built using HTML, SASS, and the jQuery library. It features a search bar that automatically retrieves and displays information when a user types in a city name.

# Usage
Simply enter the name of a city you want to search, and half a second later you'll see an unordered list of lifestyle categories appear below the search bar. The data is sourced from a service called [Teleport](https://teleport.org)
